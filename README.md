# TexRet
Texture retriever for blender.
Useful if you have different parts of a model and if you're unsure what texture is used.


Changelog:
* 1.0
  * Added Initial Script.
* 1.1
  * Fixed where it keeps fetching textures that is not used.
  * Fixed file path locations. (Report to me if you encounter something with this)

Requirements:
1. Different Models with different textures. (Still can be used with a single model)
1. It is better to run Blender as Admin (Win8 and Win10)

Credits:
* Crantisz (Really helped me alot)

Happy Modeling! ~Quaddy
